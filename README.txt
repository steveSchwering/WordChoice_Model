The WordChoice model attempts to use neural networks to understand how words are chosen in sequence. To that end, I implemented a recurrent neural network using tensorflow.

The 'ExploringModels' folder contains models and the tools to analyze those models.
The '_Deprecated' folder contains old files that I have yet to delete

This is an ongoing project with code designed for research purposes and to develop an understanding of both the tensorflow package and machine learning, in general.
